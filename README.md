# Generating handwritten digits with Generative Adversarial Network using Keras.



This is the final project for completion of Data Science bootcamp organized by Sages. The goal of the project is to generate images of handwritten digits. We use Generative Adversarial Network which is a type of neural network consisting of two partial networks: generator and discriminator. These parts work 'against' each other like 'policeman' and 'forger'. 

Technologies used in the project are:
* Python 3.6
* Jupyter Notebook
* Keras (with Tensorflow backend)
* NumPy
* matplotlib



Projects consists of six parts:
1. Preparation
2. Building components of GAN
3. Training algorithm
4. Training the network
5. Generate images with GAN
6. Loss function and accuracy

Below we can see resulting images generated by our network:
